# TryHackMe Write-Ups

Hi! I'm Abdul Rafay and I'm starting this repository to share my personal write-ups for the rooms I complete on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). The goal is to document what I learn, track my progress, and hopefully help others who are also learning cybersecurity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
These write-ups are for educational purposes only. Please do not use any of this information for illegal activities. Always follow ethical hacking guidelines.

## üìÅ Structure
Each room will have its own folder with a `README.md` file inside that explains the steps I followed to complete it. Some write-ups might also include screenshots, notes, or commands used.
